Project created to make an automated pipeline that takes information from Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata and the MovieLens rating data. Perform an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) on the data to an existing PostgreSQL database.\

For this analysis, the following steps were taken:
1. write an ETL function to read three data files,
2. extract and transform the Wikipedia data,
3. extract and transform the Kaggle and rating data,
4. load the data to a PostgreSQL Movie Database.
